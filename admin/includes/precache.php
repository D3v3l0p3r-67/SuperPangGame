// Keeping the offline copy honest after a save.
//
// The service worker answers from its cache FIRST, and it only rebuilds
// that cache when service-worker.js's CACHE_VERSION changes -- which is a
// hash of every precached file's contents, written by
// tools/build_precache.mjs at release time. A file written through this
// admin tool never went through that tool, so nothing told any browser
// that anything had changed: the game went on serving the sprite it had
// downloaded first, through hard reloads and all, because a hard reload
// empties the HTTP cache and not the worker's.
//
// So a save does here exactly what the tool would have done for that one
// file: rehash it, write the hash into sw-precache.json, recompute the
// manifest's own version and put it in the worker. The next time any
// browser loads the game it fetches service-worker.js, sees different
// bytes, installs -- copying the 300-odd unchanged files straight out of
// the cache it already has and fetching only what actually changed -- and
// the page reloads itself once (see js/pwa.js).
//
// It must produce the SAME version string the tool would, byte for byte,
// or the next release run would look like a change that is not one:
//   per file   sha256 of its contents, first 16 hex characters
//   overall    sha256 over each path followed by its hash, first 12,
//              prefixed "super-pang-", in the manifest's own file order
// (see tools/build_precache.mjs, which is the original of both).
