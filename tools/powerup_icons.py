"""Draws the pickup icons for the power-ups that have a glyph here.

    python3 tools/powerup_icons.py

Same shape as every other power-up icon (assets/powerups/<type>.webp,
18x18): a round disc in the power-up's own colour with a glyph cut into
it in a darker tone of the same hue. The glyph says what is in the box --
a barbed spear, a two-pronged hook, a bank of barrels, a stick of
dynamite, an hourglass -- because "something drops" is not useful to a
player who cannot tell WHICH thing from across the playfield.

Only the types in GLYPHS below are written, so the icons drawn by hand
(shield, the fruit, and the rest) are never overwritten by running this.
The disc colours come from each type's own elements/powerup-*.json rather
than being repeated here. All three weapons share one yellow: a weapon is
a weapon, and which one it is has to be read off the glyph in any case --
the frame in the HUD shows one at a time, and on the field the disc is a
weapon dropping rather than an effect on a clock.

#
# Written here, next to the discs, because the two have to say the same
# thing: the pickup that drops on the field and the icon that appears in
# the frame when it is collected are one weapon, and a change to either
# that misses the other leaves the game showing two. They are separate
# drawings rather than one scaled up because 18px of disc and 21px of
# frame do not divide into each other, and a doubled-up glyph in the HUD
# would be twice as coarse as everything around it.
#
# The shapes have to carry the whole difference, because the colour no
# longer does any of it: all three weapons are one yellow. So no two of
# them share an outline -- the harpoon flares outward into barbs, the
# grapple opens into two prongs, the machine gun is three barrels over a
# body. Before, the grapple and the machine gun were the same teal in
# near enough the same shape, and the frame could not be read at a
# glance, which is the only thing it is for.
