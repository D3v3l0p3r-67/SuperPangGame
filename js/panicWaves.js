// Panic Mode's waves: what they are made of, how long they take, and
// whether they can be cleared.
//
// This is the whole model, and it lives here rather than in a build tool
// because three different things need it and none of them may disagree
// about it: GameScene runs the waves, tools/panic_waves.mjs checks and
// converts them, and the tests re-check what shipped. No Node imports,
// no Phaser -- a browser, a build script and a test runner can all load
// it.
//
// A WAVE IS A RHYTHM
//
// Each wave is a beat length and a pattern of tokens, one token per
// beat, which reads as what it does:
//
//   { "beat": 3, "spawn": "r1 . r1 . x2 . h1 . |8" }
//
//   r1     drop a round ball of size 1, then wait one beat
//   .      wait one beat, dropping nothing
//   |8     HOLD here while the field still has balls on it, up to 8s
//
// A PATTERN IS THE SLOWEST THE WAVE CAN GO
//
// Waiting on an empty field is the least interesting thing this mode can
// ask of anyone, so it does not: a rest is skipped, and a hold released,
// once the field holds less than `skipRestUnderSec` of shooting -- the
// same measure the patterns themselves are costed in, so "nearly clear"
// means one straggler rather than a ball count.
//
// That is a rule about the FIELD, not about where a token sits, which is
// what keeps the notation readable: `.` still means the same thing
// everywhere, and what a pattern describes is the wave at its slowest.
//
// It cannot run away with itself either, and the reason is worth
// stating: skipping is only possible while the player is ahead, and it
// stops the instant they are not. A wave cannot compress itself into
// something its player was not already clearing.
//
// Ball tokens and rests both take exactly one beat -- that is what makes
// the pattern a grid you can read down a column of. A hold is not a beat
// at all: it is a condition, it takes zero time on a field that is
// already clear, and it never counts towards the wave's length.
//
// WHY A HOLD IS A SEPARATE TOKEN
//
// The trailing silence of a wave exists so the player can finish what is
// on the field. Making `.` mean "a beat, unless the field is empty, in
// which case skip it" would have been the obvious shortcut and it would
// have ruined the notation: a symbol whose meaning depends on where it
// sits cannot be read. So the two are separate, and what a pattern says
// is what happens.
//
// The hold's cap is not a nicety. A field nobody can clear would
// otherwise stop the mode dead, which is the same reason the rest that
// came before this had a maximum.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS, AND WHY THAT IS CHECKABLE
//
// Every hit replaces one ball with two of the next size down, so taking
// a ball off the field entirely is the whole tree beneath it: 2^N - 1
// shots. At `shotTimeSec` a shot, a wave's pattern costs a known number
// of seconds of shooting, and it hands them over across a known number
// of beats:
//
//   pressure = work / (beat * beats in the pattern)
//
// which is the share of the player's shooting time the ceiling claims.
// At 1.0 they must land every shot, forever, and never move. Everything
// below 1.0 is what is left for dodging, missing, and walking somewhere.
//
// Holds are left out of that denominator ON PURPOSE. A hold can only
// ever give the player more time, so counting it would make the check
// optimistic -- and a check you only pass because the player was
// struggling is not a check. The same goes for the seconds a ball spends
// squeezing through the ceiling: it delays the threat, so it is slack,
// and slack is not counted.

// Shots to clear a ball of this size away entirely -- the whole split
// tree, not the one hit that is being aimed right now.
